About
=====

**Pyrogram** is a brand new Telegram_ Client Library written from the ground up in Python and C. It can be used for building
custom Telegram applications in Python that interact with the MTProto API as both User and Bot.

Features
--------

-   **Easy to setup**: Pyrogram can be easily installed using pip and requires very few lines of code to get started with.

-   **Easy to use**: Pyrogram provides idiomatic, clean and readable Python code making the Telegram API simple to use.

-   **High-level**: Pyrogram automatically handles all the low-level details of communication with Telegram servers.

-   **Updated**: Pyrogram makes use of the latest Telegram MTProto API version, currently Layer 76.

-   **Fast**: Pyrogram critical parts are boosted up by `TgCrypto`_, a high-performance Crypto Library written in pure C.

-   **Documented**: Pyrogram API methods are documented and resemble the well established Telegram Bot API,
    thus offering a familiar look to Bot developers.

-   **Full API support**: Beside the simple Bot API-like methods, Pyrogram also provides an easy access to every single
    Telegram MTProto API method allowing you to programmatically execute any action an official client is able to do, and more.


Requirements
------------

-   Python 3.4 or higher.

-   A Telegram API key.


Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

-   You can install and upgrade Pyrogram using pip:

    .. code:: shell

        $ pip3 install --upgrade pyrogram

Configuration
-------------

-   Create a new ``config.ini`` file at the root of your working directory, copy-paste
    the following and replace the **api_id** and **api_hash** values with `your own`_:

    .. code:: ini

        [pyrogram]
        api_id = 12345
        api_hash = 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

Usage
-----

-   And here is how Pyrogram looks like:

    .. code:: python

        from pyrogram import Client

        client = Client("example")
        client.start()

        client.send_message("me", "Hi there! I'm using Pyrogram")

        client.stop()

That's all you need for getting started with Pyrogram. For more detailed information,
please refer to the Documentation_ and the Examples_ folder.
